<p>
    The OLCI MPH Processor calculates chl-a concentrations by means of the <u><b>M</b></u>aximum <u><b>P</b></u>eak
    <u><b>H</b></u>eight and specific arithmetic expressions for different water types. Flags for floating material,
    eucaryote/cyanobacteria dominance and an adjacency effect indicator are provided for each pixel.
    <br> <br>
    The processor was originally developed for the processing of MERIS products in the BEAM toolbox.
    This processor has been migrated to SNAP, using the same underlying algorithm which has been adapted to OLCI
    by just replacing the MERIS bands by the corresponding OLCI bands at the same (or closest) wavelength.
    The algorithm for OLCI requires as input data either OLCI L1 radiances or
    bottom-of-Rayleigh (BRR) corrected reflectances derived from the OLCI spectral bands.
    An OLCI BRR product can be processed using the Rayleigh correction processor available from
    SNAP Desktop -> Optical --> Preprocessing, or the corresponding GPT processor.
</p>

<p>
    Using the option to export intermediate MPH calculations allows the user to customize arithmetic expressions for
    calculating chl-a.
