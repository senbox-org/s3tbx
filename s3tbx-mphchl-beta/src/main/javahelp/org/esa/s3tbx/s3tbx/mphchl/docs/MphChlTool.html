    The MPH Processor calculates chl-a concentrations by means of the <u><b>M</b></u>aximum <u><b>P</b></u>eak
    <u><b>H</b></u>eight and specific arithmetic expressions for different water types. Flags for floating material,
    eucaryote/cyanobacteria dominance and an adjacency effect indicator are provided for each pixel.
    <br> <br>
    The processor was originally developed for the processing of MERIS products in the BEAM toolbox.
    This processor has been migrated to SNAP and was extended to support OLCI products,
    using the same underlying algorithm which has been adapted
    by just replacing the MERIS bands by the corresponding OLCI bands at the same wavelength.
    <!--
    Furthermore, the processor also supports  now MERIS products of the latest 4th reprocessing in which
    the product format and many of the product properties were adapted to the up-to-date OLCI specifications.
    -->
    The algorithm requires as input data either L1b radiances or
    bottom-of-Rayleigh (BRR) corrected reflectances derived from the OLCI or MERIS spectral bands.
    A BRR product can be processed using the Rayleigh correction processor available from
    SNAP Desktop -> Optical --> Preprocessing, or the corresponding GPT processor. If the input is
    an OLCI or MERIS L1b product, the Rayleigh correction is automatically performed as a
    preprocessing step within the MPH processor.

<p>
    Using the option to export intermediate MPH calculations allows the user to customize arithmetic expressions for
    calculating chl-a.
