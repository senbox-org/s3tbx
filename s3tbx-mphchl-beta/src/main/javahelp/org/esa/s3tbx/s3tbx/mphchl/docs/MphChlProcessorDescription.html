<h2>Processor user interface</h2>
<p>
    The MPH/CHL processor is invoked from the 'Optical --> Thematic Water Processing' menu by selecting the
    'MPH/CHL Processor' command.
    On the command line the MPH/CHL processor is available by means of the Graph Processing Tool <i>gpt</i>
    which is located in the SNAP bin directory. Typing <i>gpt MphChl -h</i> displays further information.
</p>

<p>
    Selecting the 'MPH/CHL Processor' command from the SNAP
    'Optical --> Thematic Water Processing' menu pops up the following dialog:
</p>
<p align="center"><img src="images/user_interface.png"></p>

<h3>Source Product Group</h3>

<p><b>Source Product</b>: Here the user specifies the source product, which can be either an OLCI or MERIS L1b product,
    or a product containing bottom-of-Rayleigh corrected
    reflectances, which was generated with the Rayleigh correction processor available in
    'Optical --> Preprocessing --> Rayleigh correction'. The combo box presents a list of all products open in SNAP.
    The user may select one of these or, by clicking on the button next to the combo box, choose a product from the
    file system.
</p>

<h3>Target Product Group:</h3>

<p><b>Name</b>: Used to specify the name of the target product</p>

<p><b>Save as</b>: Used to specify whether the target product should be saved to the file system.
    The combo box presents a list of available file formats. The text field or the button next to it allow to specify
    a target directory.
</p>

<p><b>Open in SNAP</b>: Used to specify whether the target product should be opened in SNAP. When the target
    product is not saved, it is opened in SNAP automatically.
</p>

<h3>Processing Parameters Panel</h3>

<!--
<p><b>Sensor</b>: The considered sensor. Can be either OLCI or MERIS.
</p>
-->

<p><b>Valid pixel expression</b>: An expression which identifies valid input pixels according to flags that are
    available in the input image.
</p>

<p><b>Cyano max value</b>: Threshold to cap maximum chlorophyll concentration estimated for cyanobacteria-dominant waters.</p>

<p><b>Chl thresh for float flag</b>: Value, above which cyanobacteria scum is expected, even if not indicated by a
    BRR maximum at 753 nm (see <a href="MphChlAlgorithmSpecification.html">Algorithm specification</a>, second figure).</p>

<p><b>Export mph</b>: Write the internally calculated MPH value to a separate band for the evaluation of custom peak
    height to concentration conversions.
</p>

<p><b>Apply low pass filter</b>: If selected, a 3x3 low-pass filter is applied on the CHL result image.
