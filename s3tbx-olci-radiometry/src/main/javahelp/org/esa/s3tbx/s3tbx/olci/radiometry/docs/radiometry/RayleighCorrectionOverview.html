<h3>Overview</h3>
<p>
    The Rayleigh Correction (or BRR = 'Bottom-of-Rayleigh Reflectance') Processor performs the
    Rayleigh correction on a MERIS, OLCI or S2 MSI L1C product. This simplified atmospheric correction procedure
    is a first attempt to normalise the TOA signal for gaseous and Rayleigh effects, whilst ignoring the more
    complicated and variable effects of absorbing aerosols. Furthermore, the procedure corrects
    for the significant absorption by water vapour in the band centered at 709 nm.
