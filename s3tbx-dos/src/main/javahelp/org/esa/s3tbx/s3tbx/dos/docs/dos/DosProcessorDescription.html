<h3>Processor Description</h3>

<h4>I/O Parameters Tab</h4>

<p align="center"><img src="../images/dos_io.png"></p>

<h5>Source Product Group</h5>

<p class="i1">
    Used to select the Dark Object Subtraction correction. Use the <b>...</b> buttons to
    open a data product currently not opened in the Sentinel Toolbox.
</p>

<h5>Supported Source Products</h5>
<p class="i1">
    The following source products are supported for Dark Object Subtraction:
<ul>
    <li>
        Any product which contain a band with spectral wavelength, and which is supported by SNAP.
    </li>

</ul>

<h5>Target Product Group</h5>

<p class="i1">
    <b>Name:</b>
    Used to specify the name of the target product.
</p>

<p class="i1">
    <b>Save to:</b>
    Used to specify whether the target product should be saved to the file system. The
    combo box presents a list of file formats.
</p>

<p class="i1">
    <b>Open in SNAP:</b>
    Used to specify whether the target product should be opened in the Sentinel Toolbox.
    When the target product is not saved, it is opened in the Sentinel Toolbox automatically.
</p>

<h3>The Processing Parameters</h3>

<p align="center"><img src="../images/dos_parms.png"></p>

<p class="i1">
    <b>Source bands: </b><br>
    Bands to be included in the target product. DOS will be applied on spectral bands only, other selected bands will be
    copied
    to the target product as they are.
</p>

<p class="i1">
    <b>Dark object search area: </b><br>
    Mask expression, which specifies the area of the source product, which will be used to calculate the value of dark object correction.
</p>

<p class="i1">
    <b>Percentile of minimum in image data: </b><br>
    A bottom reflectance percentile which will be considered as a dark object.
</p>

<h3>The Processing Result</h3>

<p>
    The Dark Object Subtraction processor creates a target product
    which contains only the bands selected by the user. The spectral wavelength bands are computed by the operator
    while the other bands are just copied from the source.
