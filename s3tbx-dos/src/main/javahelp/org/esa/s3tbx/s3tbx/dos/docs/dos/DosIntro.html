    The Slope Calculation processor provides the computation of terrain slope and aspect angle from
    a given altitude band in the source product. Slope and aspect are simply computed from the altitudes
    in a moving 3x3 pixel window around the considered pixel.

    The computation is completely sensor independent. The source product just needs to contain an altitude band,
    a geocoding, and its format must be supported by SNAP.
