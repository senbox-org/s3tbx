    The Dark Object Subtraction processor implements the computation of simple empirical atmospheric correction
    method in the source product. Dark object subtraction searches each band for the darkest pixel value.
    The scattering is removed by subtracting this value from every pixel in the band.

    The computation is completely sensor independent. The user just needs to select a band with spectral wavelength from a source product,
     and its format must be supported by SNAP.
