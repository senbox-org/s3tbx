<h3>Algorithm Specification</h3>

<h4>Slope computation</h4>

<p class="i1">

    If alt<i>n</i> with <i>n</i> = 1..9 are the altitudes consecutively numbered in a 3x3 window around the
    considered pixel, the slope is computed as <br> <br>

    b = (alt3 + 2 * alt6 + alt9 - alt1 - 2 * alt4 - alt7) / 8<br>

    c = (alt1 + 2 * alt2 + alt3 - alt7 - 2 * alt8 - alt9) / 8<br>  <br>

    <b>SLOPE</b> = atan(sqrt(b/X * b/X + c/X * c/X)) <br> <br>


<h4>Aspect computation</h4>

<p class="i1">

    If alt<i>n</i> with <i>n</i> = 1..9 are the altitudes consecutively numbered in a 3x3 window around the
    considered pixel, the aspect is computed as <br> <br>

    b = (alt3 + 2 * alt6 + alt9 - alt1 - 2 * alt4 - alt7) / 8<br>

    c = (alt1 + 2 * alt2 + alt3 - alt7 - 2 * alt8 - alt9) / 8<br>  <br>

    <b>ASPECT</b> = atan2(-b, -c) <br> <br>

    This value is finally mapped onto [0..360] in order to give the aspect as angle between North direction
    and steepest slope,
