<h3>Processor Description</h3>

<h4>I/O Parameters Tab</h4>

<p align="center"><img src="images/OlciPaths.png"></p>

<h5>Source Product Group</h5>

<p class="i1">
    <b>Name: </b>
    Used to select the spectral source product. The source product shall
    contain spectral bands providing a source spectrum at each pixel. Use the <b>...</b> button to
    open a data product currently not opened in the Sentinel Toolbox.
</p>

<h5>Supported Sentinel-3 OLCI Source Products</h5>
The following Sentinel-3 OLCI source products are supported for Idepix classification:
<ul>
    <li>
        S3A_OL_1_EFR_*.SEN3:<br>
        Full Resolution TOA Radiance, after radiometrical and spectral calibration
    </li>
    <li>
        S3A_OL_1_ERR_*.SEN3:<br>
        Reduced Resolution TOA Radiance, after radiometrical and spectral calibration
    </li>
</ul>
For detailed product descriptions and file naming conventions see the Sentinel-3 OLCI L1b Product User Guide
(https://sentinel.esa.int/web/sentinel/user-guides/sentinel-3-olci/product-types/level-1b).


<h5>Target Product Group</h5>

<p class="i1">
    <b>Name:</b>
    Used to specify the name of the target product.
</p>

<p class="i1">
    <b>Save to:</b>
    Used to specify whether the target product should be saved to the file system. The
    combo box presents a list of file formats.
</p>

<p class="i1">
    <b>Open in SNAP:</b>
    Used to specify whether the target product should be opened in the Sentinel Toolbox.
    When the target product is not saved, it is opened in the Sentinel Toolbox automatically.
</p>

<h3>The Processing Parameters</h3>

<p align="center"><img src="images/OlciParameters.png"></p>

<p class="i1">
    <b>Select TOA radiances to write to the target product: </b><br>
    The TOA radiance bands from the source product which shall be written into the target product can be selected here.
    Multiple selection is possible.
</p>

<p class="i1">
    <b>Select TOA reflectances to write to the target product: </b><br>
    The intermediately computed TOA reflectances bands which shall be written into the target product can be selected here.
    Multiple selection is possible.
</p>

<p class="i1">
    <b>Write NN value to the target product: </b><br>
    If selected, the output value of the neural network
    (floating point number on the interval [0.0, 5.0]) is written to the target product. The default is 'false'.
</p>

<p class="i1">
    <b>Compute cloud shadow: </b><br>
    If set, a cloud shadow is computed and added to the pixel classification. The default value is 'true'.
</p>

<p class="i1">
    <b>Compute a cloud buffer: </b><br>
    If set, a cloud buffer of certain width is computed and added to the pixel classification. The default value is 'true'.
</p>

<p class="i1">
    <b>Width of cloud buffer (# of pixels): </b><br>
    If a cloud buffer is computed, the buffer width (in # of pixels around the cloudy reference pixel) can be specified.
    The default value is '2'.
</p>

<p class="i1">
    <b>Use SRTM Land/Water mask: </b><br>
    If set, a land/water mask derived from the SRTM (Shuttle Radar Topography Mission) dataset is used instead
    of the land flag included in the Sentinel-3 OLCI L1b product. The SRTM land/water mask is usually more precise in specific
    case (e.g. inland lakes), but slows down the processing speed. The default value is 'false'.
</p>

<h3>The Processing Result</h3>
The Idepix classification result is written into the target product as a flag band named 'pixel_classif_flags'.
This band holds integer values which for Sentinel-3 OLCI follow the flag coding shown below.

The target product also provides a corresponding flag mask to visualize the pixel classification through the
SNAP Mask Manager:
