<h3>Algorithm Specification</h3>

<h4>Neural network classification</h4>

<p>
    The Idepix classification algorithm for Envisat MERIS is based on a neural network approach. Separate neural nets
    are used for land and water pixels.
    As input for the neural nets, the square roots of the MERIS TOA reflectances (obtained from an internal
    radiance-to-reflectance conversion) in all 15 bands are used.

As output, the neural net finally provides per pixel one of the properties 'cloud sure',
'cloud ambiguous', 'cloud' (which means sure OR ambiguous) ,  or 'snow/ice'.

<h4>Additional properties</h4>
<p>
    The following additional pixel properties are provided from the classification:
<ul>
    <li>
        'cloud_buffer': For pixels identified as cloudy, a cloud buffer of specified width can be set by the user to finally obtain a more
        conservative cloud mask. This is done in a post-processing step after the cloud classification has been applied
        on the full image. The cloud buffer algorithm works on pixel windows of size (2N+1) x (2N+1) with N = cloud buffer
        width. Note that the cloud buffer is only applied on cloud-free pixels, i.e. cloudy pixels are not flagged as cloud
        buffer of cloudy neighbour pixels.
        The cloud buffer procedure is described in a bit more detail in the CCI Land Cover ATBD [1].
    </li>
    <li>
        'cloud_shadow': For pixels identified as CLOUD, a cloud shadow algorithm can be optionally applied. This algorithm determines
        the shadow from cloudy pixels by simple geometric calculations using the sun zenith angle and the cloud top
        pressure, which in return is obtained from another neural network approach which was developed by
        Free University of Berlin. The cloud shadow procedure is described in more detail in the CCI Land Cover ATBD [1].
    </li>
    <li>
        'land': the pixel is located over land
    </li>
    <li>
        'coastline': the pixel is a coastline pixel
    </li>
    <li>
        'glint risk': the pixel is a water pixel and has a risk for sun glint. The glint risk is estimated
        from the sun angles and the horizontal and meridional wind components, which are all included in the MERIS
        tie point grids.
    </li>
</ul>

The 'land' and 'coastline' pixels are identified from an SRTM (Shuttle Radar Topography Mission) land/water mask [2].
This is a fractional mask:
<ul>
    <li>
        water fraction = 0 : 'land'
    </li>
    <li>
        water fraction &gt; 0 and  water fraction  &lt; 100: 'coastline'
    </li>
    <li>
        water fraction = 100: 'water'
    </li>
</ul>

<h4>Final classification flags</h4>
<p>
    In summary, from the algorithm steps outlined above, the following final classification flags are provided for
    Envisat MERIS:
<ul>
    <li>
        'INVALID' (input invalid or no classification possible)
    </li>
    <li>
        'CLOUD' (which means either CLOUD_AMBIGUOUS or CLOUD_SURE)
    </li>
    <li>
        'CLOUD_AMBIGUOUS'
    </li>
    <li>
        'CLOUD_SURE'
    </li>
    <li>
        'CLOUD_BUFFER'
    </li>
    <li>
        'CLOUD_SHADOW'
    </li>
    <li>
        'SNOW_ICE'
    </li>
    <li>
        'COASTLINE'
    </li>
    <li>
        'LAND'
    </li>
    <li>
        'GLINT'
    </li>
</ul>

<h4>Known issues</h4>
<p>
    The geometrical determination of a cloud shadow is known to be difficult, as the cloud height (retrieved
    from the cloud top pressure) needs to be known rather precisely.
    Therefore, the cloud shadow results may sometimes be poor.
</p>
<p>
    The following pixel properties are currently NOT provided for MERIS:
<ul>
    <li>
        'BRIGHT'
    </li>
    <li>
        'WHITE'
    </li>
    <li>
        'MIXED_PIXEL'
    </li>
</ul>
