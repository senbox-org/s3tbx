<p>
    The Maximum Peak Height (MPH) algorithm exploits bottom-of-Rayleigh reflectance peaks in the red and near-infrared bands
    above a baseline, which is drawn between the bands at 664nm, and 885nm (Matthews et al., 2012). This baseline technique is
    basically the same used in the Fluorescence Line Height (FLH) and Maximum Chlorophyll Index (MCI) algorithms (Gower
    et al., 1999).
</p>

<p>
    Different reflectance peak positions occur mostly as a consequence of pigment concentration levels, and these peaks'
    heights depend on specific optical drivers (Figure 1).

<p>
    For the most common water types, MPH selects a suitable baseline
    using a sequence of predefined conditions and thresholds (Figure 2).

Note that this diagram shows the original
MERIS bands. The mapping from the required MERIS BRR to OLCI BRR bands is as follows:

<table>
    <tr class="header">
        <td>MERIS BRR band</td> <td>Wavelength (nm)</td> <td>OLCI BRR band</td> <td>Wavelength (nm)</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>brr_6</td>  <td>619</td> <td>rBRR_07</td> <td>620</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>brr_7</td>  <td>664</td> <td>rBRR_08</td> <td>665</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>brr_8</td>  <td>681</td> <td>rBRR_10</td> <td>681.25</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>brr_9</td>  <td>709</td> <td>rBRR_11</td> <td>708.75</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>brr_10</td> <td>753</td> <td>rBRR_12</td> <td>753.75</td>
