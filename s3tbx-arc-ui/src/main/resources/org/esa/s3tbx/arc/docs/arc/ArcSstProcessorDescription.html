<h3>User Interface</h3>

<p>
    The SST processor can be invoked in the Sentinel Toolbox from the tool menu by selecting
    <b>Optical->Thematic Water Processing->ARC SST Processing...</b>.
    On the command line the SST processor is available by means of the Graph Processing Tool <code>gpt</code>
    which is located in the Sentinel Toolbox <code>bin</code> directory.
    Typing <code>gpt Arc.SST -h</code> displays further information.
</p>

<p>
    Selecting the <b>ARC SST Processor</b> from the Sentinel Toolbox tool menu pops up the following dialog:
</p>

<p align="center"><img src="images/ArcSstPaths.png"></p>

<h5>Source Product Group</h5>

<p class="i1">
    <b>(A)ATSR or SLSTR:</b>
    Here the user specifies the source product. The combo box presents
    a list of all products open in the Sentinel Toolbox. The user may select one of these
    or, by clicking on the button next to the combo box, choose a product
    from the file system.
</p>

<h5>Target Product Group</h5>

<p class="i1">
    <b>Name:</b>
    Used to specify the name of the target product.
</p>

<p class="i1">
    <b>Save as:</b>
    Used to specify whether the target product should be saved to the file system. The
    combo box presents a list of available file formats.
    The text field or the button next to it allow to specify a target directory.
</p>

<p class="i1">
    <b>Open in SNAP:</b>
    Used to specify whether the target product should be opened in SNAP.
    When the target product is not saved, it is opened in SNAP automatically.
</p>

<p align="center"><img src="images/ArcSstParams.png"></p>

<h5>Processing Parameters Panel</h5>

<p class="i1">
    <b>Total Column Water Vapour:</b> (ATSR-only) Here the user can specify which value of TCWV should
    be used in the retrieval. This can be a constant or a Band Math expression. This parameter is only
    used for ATSR inputs. When processing SLSTR data the TCWV is included in the L1 file.
</p>

<p class="i1">
    <b>Generate ASDI:</b> Here the processing of Saharan Dust Index can be activated or deactivated.
</p>

<p class="i1">
    <b>ASDI coefficient file:</b>
    Here one of the available coefficient sets for ASDI processing can be selected.
</p>

<p class="i1">
    <b>ASDI mask:</b> Here a ROI-mask expression can be defined that will be evaluated
    during Saharan Dust Index processing.
</p>

<p class="i1">
    <b>Generate dual-view SST:</b> Here the processing of dual-view SST can be activated or deactivated.
</p>

<p class="i1">
    <b>Dual-view coefficient file:</b>
    Here one of the available coefficient sets for dual-view processing can be selected.
</p>

<p class="i1">
    <b>Dual-view mask:</b> Here a ROI-mask expression can be defined that will be evaluated
    during dual-view processing.
</p>

<p class="i1">
    <b>Generate nadir-view SST:</b> Here the processing of nadir-view SST can be activated or deactivated.
</p>

<p class="i1">
    <b>Nadir-view coefficient file:</b>
    Here one of the available coefficient sets for nadir-view processing can be selected.
</p>

<p class="i1">
    <b>Nadir-view mask:</b> Here a ROI-mask expression can be defined that will be evaluated
    during nadir-view processing.
</p>

<p class="i1">
    <b>Invalid SST value:</b>
    The value written to a target pixel when the pixel is excluded from the ROI or the SST calculation yields
    an invalid result.
</p>

<h5>Button Group</h5>

<p class="i1">
    <b>Run</b>
    Creates the target product. The SST processing is actually deferred until its band data are accessed, either by
    writing the product to a file or by viewing its band data. When the <b>Save as</b> option is checked, the SST
    processing is triggered automatically.
</p>

<p class="i1">
    <b>Close</b>
    Closes the dialog.
</p>

<h5>Menu Group</h5>

<p class="i1">
    <b>File</b>
    The entries found in this menu allow to save the current processing parameters to disk and to open a saved parameter
    set from disk.
</p>

<p class="i1">
    <b>Help</b>
    Displays this help page.
