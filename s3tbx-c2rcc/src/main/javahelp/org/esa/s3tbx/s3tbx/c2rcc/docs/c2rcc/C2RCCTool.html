<h3>Overview</h3>
<p>The Case 2 Regional CoastColour (C2RCC) atmospheric correction is a full spectrum version using a set of neural
    networks which are trained on simulated top-of-atmosphere reflectance. The raditiave transfer simulations include
    the full
    ocean and atmosphere system, i.e. a specific water model is included in the simulations.
    C2RCC is used to generate the Case 2 water products in Sentinel 3 OLCI standard ESA products,
    as well as in the upcoming MERIS 4th Reprocessing.
    Products generated are the inherent optical properties (IOPs), absorption and scattering of the different
    constituents; the three major optically relevant concentrations, i.e. phytoplankton pigments, total suspended matter
    and yellow
    substance; and their related uncertainties.<br>
    It supports several sensors: starting from Sentinel-3 OLCI over Sentinel-2 MSI to
    Landsat-8 OLI and the heritage sensor MERIS, both in 3rd and 4th reprocessing versions. MODIS, VIIRS and SeaWiFS
    are supported as well.<br>
