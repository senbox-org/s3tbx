<img src="images/proc_params/c2rcc_seawifs_proc_params.png" align="right"/>

<ul>
    <li><b>Valid-pixel expression</b><br>
        The arithmetic expression defines the pixels which are valid for processing. Pixels which are not valid will be marked as no-data in the
        target product.
    </li>
    <li><b>Salinity</b><br>
        The value used as water salinity for the scene.
    </li>
    <li><b>Temperature</b><br>
        The value used as water temperature for the scene.
    </li>
    <li><b>Ozone</b><br>
        The value used as ozone if not provided by auxiliary data
    </li>
    <li><b>Air Pressure</b><br>
        The surface air pressure at sea level if not provided by auxiliary data
    </li>
    <li><b>Output AC reflectances as rrs instead of rhow</b><br>
        Reflectance values in the target product shall be written as remote sensing reflectances and not as water leaving reflectances
    </li>
    <li><b>Output TOSA reflectances</b><br>
        Can be enabled to include the TOSA reflectances in the target product.
    </li>
</ul>
