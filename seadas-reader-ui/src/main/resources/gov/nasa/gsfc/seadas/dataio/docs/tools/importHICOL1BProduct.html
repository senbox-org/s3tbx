<h2>Import HICO L1B Product</h2>

<p>The <a href="http://hico.coas.oregonstate.edu">Hyperspectral Imager for Coastal Observations</a> (HICO&trade;)is an imaging
spectrometer based on the PHILLS airborne imaging spectrometers.
HICO samples selected coastal regions at 90 m with full spectral coverage (380 to 960 nm sampled at 5.7 nm)
and a very high signal-to-noise ratio to resolve the complexity of the coastal ocean.
</p>
<p>For the first three years, HICO was sponsored by the Office of Naval Research as an Innovative Naval Prototype (INP).
Support is now provided by NASA's International Space Station (ISS) Program.</p>

<p>This SeaDAS product reader is for the HICO L1B files in the HDF5 format.</p>
