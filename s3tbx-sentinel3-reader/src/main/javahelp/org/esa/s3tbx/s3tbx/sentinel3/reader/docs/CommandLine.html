<h3>Command Line Description</h3>

Since the MERIS L1b Fourth to Third Reprocessing Adaptation  processor makes use of the SNAP graph processing framework, it can be
used also as a command line tool. The graph processing is invoked
by the command
<ul>
    <li>
        ${SNAP-INSTALL-DIR}/bin/gpt
    </li>
</ul>

To obtain general help on the graph processing, use the command
<ul>
    <li>
        ${SNAP-INSTALL-DIR}/bin/gpt -h
    </li>
</ul>

Specific help on the MERIS L1b Fourth to Third Reprocessing Adaptation processor can be obtained with
<ul>
    <li>
        ${SNAP-INSTALL-DIR}/bin/gpt -h Meris.Reprocessing.Adapter.4To3
    </li>
</ul>

In this case, information on the usage of this particular processor is given.<br><br>

The MERIS L1b Fourth to Third Reprocessing Adaptation processor does not provide any user parameters.
However, as for all gpt processors, the processing setup can also be specified via a graph xml file which
    could look like the following:
<pre>

    &lt;graph id="Meris4thTo3rdReprocessingAdaptationTest"&gt;
        &lt;version&gt;1.0&lt;/version&gt;
        &lt;node id="reprocessingAdaptation"&gt;
            &lt;operator&gt;Meris.Reprocessing.Adapter.4To3&lt;/operator&gt;
            &lt;sources&gt;
                &lt;source&gt;${sourceProduct}&lt;/source&gt;
            &lt;/sources&gt;
        &lt;/node&gt;
    &lt;/graph&gt;

</pre>

This graph can be invoked by the following call on the command line:
<ul>
    <li>
        ${SNAP-INSTALL-DIR}/bin/gpt &lt;graph-file.xml&gt; -SsourceProduct=&lt;path-to-source-file&gt;
    </li>
</ul>
