<h5>Source Product Group</h5>

<p class="i1">
    <b>Name: </b>
    Used to select the spectral source product. The source product shall
    contain spectral bands providing a source spectrum at each pixel. Use the <b>...</b> button to
    open a data product currently not opened in the Sentinel Toolbox.
</p>

<h5>Supported Envisat MERIS Source Products</h5>
The following Envisat MERIS source products are supported for IdePix classification:
<ul>
    <li>
        MERIS_RR__1P*.N1:<br>
        Reduced Resolution Geolocated and Calibrated TOA Radiance (stripline)
    </li>
    <li>
        MERIS_FR__1P*.N1:<br>
        Full Resolution Geolocated and Calibrated TOA Radiance (stripline)
    </li>
    <li>
        ENV_ME_1_RRG_*.SEN3:<br>
        Reduced Resolution as above, but from 4th reprocessing
    </li>
    <li>
        ENV_ME_1_FRG_*.SEN31:<br>
        Full Resolution as above, but from 4th reprocessing
    </li>
</ul>

<p>

    combo box presents a list of file formats.
</p>

<p class="i1">
    <b>Open in SNAP:</b>
    Used to specify whether the target product should be opened in the Sentinel Toolbox.
    When the target product is not saved, it is opened in the Sentinel Toolbox automatically.
</p>

<h3>Processing Parameters</h3>

<p>No specific processing parameters are provided for the MERIS Reprocessing Adaptation Processor.</p>

<h3>The Processing Result</h3>
<p>The target product contains all bands, tie point grids, flags and masks which are available in
a corresponding ENVISAT MERIS L1b *.N1 product. Details of the adaptation procedure are given
in the <a href="AlgorithmSpecification.html">Algorithm Specification</a> documentation.
